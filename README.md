# AnkiHabitica

Stable Version: 2.0

Anki 2.0 add-on for use with Habitica. Places a progress bar on the bottom of the review screen and scores a Habitica habit when the progress bar reaches the end. Also shows your health, exp, and mana stats as percentages to the right of the progress bar.

See the wiki for more details: https://github.com/eshapard/AnkiHabitica/wiki

For use with Habitica (formerly, HabitRPG): http://habitica.com

Inspired by: https://github.com/Pherr/HabitRPG-Anki-Addon

## NEW NAME!
Formerly, AnkiHabitica was called AnkiHRPG. Habitica used to be called HabitRPG, and the name AnkiHRPG made perfect sense. However, with the name change, newer Habiticans might not recognize AnkiHRPG as a Habitica-related addon.

## INSTALLATION

1. In Anki, go to Tools >> Add-ons >> Browse & Install
2. Paste in the following code: 954979168
